For a recent project, I needed a portable tool for the recurring task of reading YAML data from an HTTP endpoint.
I was dreading the idea of implementing this with curl in shell, so I started writing the code in Go.

Go however is a compiled language and I do not like to check binary files into version control.
Instead, I wanted the tool to be distributed in a single text-file that contains common go code.

## Shebang

The first idea coming to my mind was to wrap the [`go run`](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Compile_and_run_Go_program) command in a shebang header.

```go
#!/usr/bin/env -S go run
package main

func main() {
    println("Hello, World!")
}
```

However, the syntax of Go does not allow this kind of header.

The prefix of a shebang header is `#` but that is, unlike in shell, not a valid token in Go.

```sh
$ ./shebang.go
shebang.go:1:1: illegal character U+0023 '#'
```

## Double-Path Trick

I found [this cool trick](https://gist.github.com/msoap/a9ee054f80a58b16867c) by [Serhii Mudryk](https://github.com/msoap).  
It abuses the fact that, `//` is a valid Go token (a comment) and, [as defined](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap03.html#tag_03_271) in the POSIX spec, redundant path separators `//` will be simplified to `/`.

With this trick, we can craft a file that contains valid shell code and valid Go code at the same time:

```go
//usr/bin/env -S go run "$0" "$@" ; exit
package main

func main() {
    println("Hello, World!")
}
```

To run the polyglot script:

```go
$ ./simple.go
Hello, World!
```

Looking good so far üëå

## Build Constraint

If the script is included in a Go project, the compiler will probably attempt to include the file.
To prohibit this behaviour, a [build constraint](https://pkg.go.dev/go/build#hdr-Build_Constraints) can be used like this:

```go
//usr/bin/env -S go run "$0" "$@" ; exit
//go:build exclude
package main
// ...
```

For Go <= v1.16, the constraint prefix differs and looks like this: `//+build exclude`

## Handling Dependencies

This is already very handy but the original problem also requires me to handle YAML, for that I want to use a package like [gopkg.in/yaml.v3](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/yaml.v3).

In modern Go projects, dependencies are typically declared in the project's `go.mod` file and managed by the `go` cli tool.  
Ideally we want to use the same tooling for the script.

Instead of directly calling `go run` in the script-header, we can add some additional logic to create and use a `go.mod` file on the fly.

### Piggybacking

The way of calling `env` to execute code has a big issue; `env` is a program to "run (another) program in a modified environment".  
There is no way to use shell builtins or anything that is not the reference to another program.

We want however to use the full power of the shell language. To do so, we again start the line with our double path token but this time instead of invoking `//usr/bin/env`, we are going to invoke just `//`.

`//` has the correct syntax for a shell command but semantically it does not make much sense (and returns exit code 126).  
The *sh* shell will tell us that we do not have the correct permissions: `//: Permission denied`  
The *bash* shell will tell us that `//` is a directory: `//: Is a directory`

However, we do not care about this because, all we want is a command to piggyback on.  
We can just use the *separation operator* `;` to append another command:

```sh
$ //; echo "test"
sh: 1: //: Permission denied
test
```

To get rid of the permission error, we can redirect the first commands stderr output to `/dev/null`:

```sh
$ // 2>/dev/null; echo "test"
test
```

## Generate go.mod

With this method, we can finally build our `go.mod` file!

We are going to use variables to comfortably handle some data:

- `mod_path` (the script's own module path)
- `mod_gover` (Go version the script will target)
- `mod_pkgs` (comma separated list of dependencies)

```sh
// 2>/dev/null; mod_path="hub.lol/foo/bar"
// 2>/dev/null; mod_gover="1.19"
// 2>/dev/null; mod_pkgs="github.com/spf13/pflag v1.0.5,gopkg.in/yaml.v3 v3.0.1"
```

To generate the `go.mod` file from this information, we can use `tr` and `printf`:

```sh
//usr/bin/env -S printf "module %s\n\ngo %s\n\nrequire (\n%s\n)" "${mod_path}" "${mod_gover}" "$(echo "${mod_pkgs}" | tr "," "\n")" > go.mod
```

### Temp Dir

TODO: create temp dir, copy file, generate go.mod and go.sum, build, run with project as workdir

## Autoformat

## Cleanup

## IntelliJ Formatter

## Drawbacks

drawback:
- self extracting module needs write permissions in workdir
- workdir must not contain go.mod or go.sum file

### Default Shell


INFO BOX
Sadly, by specification, there are some exceptions to this behaviour üòî  
A list of platforms where this trick does not work is found [here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/256497/on-what-systems-is-foo-bar-different-from-foo-bar) (most notably: **Cygwin** and **Bazel**).

embedded go.mod for deps
cleanup go.mod
check for existing go.mod
formatter disabler

intellij formatter

external dependencies -> go.mod

create go.mod and go.sum on demand

not nice: this is not a shebang! whatever shell is invoking this script will also be used to interpret it!
this is intended to be interpreted by bash, not sh!

todo for sh compat: remove array usage
