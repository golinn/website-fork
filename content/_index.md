Hi, my name is hub and this is my corner of the internet.

I started my professional journey in information technology in 2008, and currently I am a student of computer science.
I have done some development in Java, Go, Python and Bash, and infrastructure operations on-premise and in the cloud.
I hoard a big pile of unfinished projects and prefer to do my computing on Linux.
I live in northern Germany.
